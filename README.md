# AppsAnywhere-on-Linux

For this guide to work, you should have already completed the steps listed [here](https://github.com/sammuraii/AUSVPN-on-Linux/).

Once, you have AUSVPN running on linux. Go to paralells download page for linux [here](https://www.parallels.com/products/ras/download/links/). 
Download the right version for your distribution and install it using the steps listed [here](https://kb.parallels.com/en/123304).

Thats all! You should now be able to go to apps.aus.edu and run some apps that use the paralells client. Note that a lot of apps are incompatible with linux and won't run using this method. You can use a VM to run those, as of now I don't know any other way to make them work.
